## Overview :mag:

InsightA is an Obsidian plugin, by using LLM, it can transform long articles into concise, atomic notes, and create well-organized Map of Content (MOC). This tool is ideal for anyone aiming to distill complex information into structured, interconnected notes, drawing inspiration from the Zettelkasten method. üöÄüìù
